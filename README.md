# akaecliptic-alpha

My first attempt learning ThreeJS and early implementation of akaecliptic.dev.

Some house cleaning was done to make it more presentable. Mostly shuffling and removing redundant code.

I actually re-made https://akaecliptic.dev/ 2 times, with the 3rd being the current implementation. This is the first version.
